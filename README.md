# Hash Table And The 2-SUM Algorithm

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice using hash table. More specifically, students were asked to compute the number of distinct integer pairs that sum to values in the interval [-10000, 10000] from a given list of 1,000,000 integers.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
